# Modelling of Santa Barbara, CA Municipal Airport Temperatures
- Developed a SARIMA model for the monthly averages of daily maximum temperatures at Santa Barbara Municipal Airport from 1941 to 2021
- Skills:
  - Applied ACF (Auto-Correlation Function) and PACF (Partial Auto-Correlation Function) to create candidate models
  - Employed AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) to narrow down candidate models
  - Utilized Histograms and Shapiro-Wilk normality tests for data analysis
  - Conducted Box-Pierce tests, Box-Ljung tests, Mcleod-Li tests for model diagnostics
  - Performed Autoregressive residual fitting and analyzed residuals through residual plots
  - Utilized Q-Q plots, ACF and PACF of the residuals, as well as ACF of the residuals squared for further model diagnostics
- Language: R
